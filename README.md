# internship-portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio website where I showcased student projects I have been working on during Multimedia Design course at KEA.

## Used technologies
* HTML
* Bootstrap (I used it for the first time)
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Motion One for some animations
* a tiny bit of JSON.

## Details

Majority of the website is built with HTML and Bootstrap. I used CSS for additional styling and probably in cases where I did not know Bootstrap could be used. :)  
In order to keep the website comfortable to maintain in the future, I created HTML templates to display projects. The information about each project is stored in objects in JSON file, which are fetched and used in JS file. The website includes some animations created with Motion One library. The "typewriter" effect on h1 and h2 is written in JS.
