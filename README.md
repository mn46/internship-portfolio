# internship-portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio website where I showcased student projects I have been working on during Multimedia Design course at KEA.

## Used technologies
* HTML
* Bootstrap (I used it for the first time)
* CSS
* JavaScript
* a tiny bit of JSON.

## Details

Majority of the website is built with HTML and Bootstrap. I used CSS for additional styling and probably in cases where I did not know Bootstrap could be used. :)  
In order to keep the website comfortable to maintain in the future, I created HTML templates to display projects. The information about each project is stored in objects in JSON file, which are fetched and used in JS file. The website includes also a few CSS animations. The "typewriter" effect on h1 is written in JS (separate file: type-ani.js).
