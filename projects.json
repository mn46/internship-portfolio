The initial list of functionalities included filtering, sorting, expelling students and adding them to prefects list. Due to some radical changes in the school, each student needed a blood status which had to be concluded from separate set of data. It was later used to add 'pure-blood' students to the Inquisitorial Squad. The last task was to create a 'hack' function, break some functionalities and limit user's actions. More details are in the readme file on GitHub.",
